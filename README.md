# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict **customer churn** — whether a customer will leave a service provider — based on their historical usage data and personal characteristics. This type of predictive model is crucial for businesses to improve **customer retention** and **reduce revenue loss**.
